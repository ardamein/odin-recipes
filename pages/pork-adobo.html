    <h3><strong>Ingredient List:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pork</strong> - Use any cut of pork that you prefer. I suggest pork belly for best results. However, use leaner parts if you are trying to avoid fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong> - Use red, yellow, or white onion for this recipe. Make sure to chop it into small pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Dried Bay Leaves</strong> - This is an ingredient that you can almost always find most of the time in the spice section of your local supermarket.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole Peppercorn</strong> - It will not matter if you use crushed peppercorn or ground black pepper. Sichuan peppercorns are also good alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - Adding a teaspoon of sugar will move your pork adobo on the sweeter side. </li>
        <li><strong>2 Cups Water</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Salt to Taste</strong></li><br>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Cook Pork Adobo:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate The Pork Belly In Soy Sauce And Crushed Garlic:</strong><br>
            The first thing to do is marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and crushed garlic. It is best to marinate it overnight. If time is limited, one hour should be enough. 
            Some like to add vinegar during the process. You may do so if preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown The Marinated Pork:</strong><br>
            Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated pork needs to be browned. Heat a cooking pot. Add pork with garlic. 
            You can also add a few tablespoons of cooking oil. Cook the pork until it turns brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour Water And Add The Spices:</strong><br>
            Cook the pork until tender. Do this by pouring the remaining marinade, if any. 
            Also add water. Let the liquid boil.<br>
            This is the part where I put the whole peppercorn and dried bay leaves. These ingredients complete my pork adobo. Boiling for 40 minutes should be enough to tenderize the pork. 
            There are times when you have to cook longer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Vinegar:</strong><br>
            If you have not added the vinegar as part of the marinade, pour it into the pot and let it cook for 10 minutes. Salt is an optional ingredient for this recipe. 
            Use it only if you think it is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong><br>
            Taste the sauce first so that you know what seasonings to add. Since we already added a good amount of soy sauce, salt might not be needed. However, this depends on your preference. 
            You can also add more water here if you think that then saltiness is on the upper side. Sometimes I also add a dash of sugar to balance the flavor.</li>    

    </ol>
